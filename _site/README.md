## About
The UT Robot Learning Reading Group meets weekly to discuss the latest papers in robot learning.
This group is run by the [Robot Perception and Learning Lab](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~yukez/lab/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
**This group will commence in Spring 2021, and will be accessible to all UT Austin students.**

## Logistics
Each week, we meet for one hour to discuss one paper in depth.
One student will lead each meeting with a presentation on the paper.
Meetings will be held on Zoom and the exact time is TBD.

We follow the latest papers in robotics and embodied AI, spanning topics such as computer vision, reinforcement learning, neuro-symbolic AI, and control.
We particularly focus on papers from
[CoRL](https://www.robot-learning.org/), [RSS](https://roboticsconference.org/), and [CVPR](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/).

## How to Join
This group is currently maintained by [Soroush Nasiriany](http://snasiriany.me/).
